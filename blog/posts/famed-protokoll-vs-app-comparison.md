## Real User Experiences

### Book-Only User: Dr. Sarah K. (Nigeria)

> "I bought just the book because I wanted to save money. I studied it cover to cover twice. I passed (62%), but barely. Looking back, I should have done way more practice questions. The book gave me knowledge but not enough application practice."

**Lesson:** Book alone can work, but you'll struggle with time management and question formats

---

### App-Only User: Dr. Raj M. (India)

> "I did 2,500 questions on the app and passed with 74%. The app was perfect for me—I could study on my train commute. But there were a few concepts I didn't fully understand because the explanations were brief. Had to Google some topics."

**Lesson:** App works great for practice but may leave conceptual gaps

---

### Both Resources: Dr. Elena P. (Romania)

> "Best decision ever. I used the book to learn each topic deeply, then tested myself with the app. The combination helped me score 81%. The book made me understand WHY, the app made me practice WHAT. Perfect combo."

**Lesson:** Synergy between deep learning and active practice produces best results

---

## Our Recommendation by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Limited Budget (<€150)

**Start with:** FaMED App (3 months)  
**Why:** Better ROI, higher pass rate than book alone  
**Add:** Free resources (Amboss trial, DEGAM guidelines)

---

### Scenario 2: Moderate Budget (€150-300)

**Invest in:** Book + App (2 months)  
**Why:** Best of both worlds within budget  
**Strategy:** Use book for deep learning, app for daily practice

---

### Scenario 3: Unlimited Budget + Serious About Passing

**Why:** Maximum coverage, support, and practice  
**Total cost:** €500-800  
**Expected outcome:** 90-95% pass rate

---

### Scenario 4: Retaking After Failure

## The Bottom Line

### If You Can Only Choose One

**Choose the App if:**
- Budget <€150
- Timeline <8 weeks
- Strong medical fundamentals
- Study on-the-go
- Data-driven learner

**Choose the Book if:**
- Learning German medical terminology from scratch
- 12+ weeks available
- Prefer deep, structured learning
- Want permanent reference
- Don't like screen time

### The Optimal Strategy

**Get both if you can afford it.** The 89% pass rate and 76% average score speak for themselves.

**Can't afford both?** Start with the app, then buy the book with your first doctor salary! You'll want it as a reference anyway.

---

## Final Calculation: What's Your Time Worth?

**Scenario A:** Save €100, use app only, 79% pass rate
- **21% chance of failing** = €250 retake fee + 3 months delayed career start
- 3 months German doctor salary: €15,000-20,000 opportunity cost
- **Total risk:** €15,250-20,250

**Scenario B:** Invest €299 in both, 89% pass rate
- **11% chance of failing** = much lower risk
- Higher confidence, better score, faster pass
- **Total risk:** much lower

**The math is clear:** Investing an extra €100-150 to improve your pass rate by 10-12% is a no-brainer.

---

## Conclusion

Both the FaMED Protokoll book and FaMED App are excellent resources. The data clearly shows:

1. **App alone** beats book alone (79% vs 68% pass rate)
2. **Both together** beats either alone (89% pass rate)
3. **ROI is massive** regardless of which you choose
4. **Every point matters** when you're near the 60% pass threshold

Our recommendation: **If you can afford €299 total, invest in both.** If not, prioritize the app.

The small investment difference now could mean the difference between passing on attempt #1 vs #2—saving you months of time and thousands in opportunity cost.
