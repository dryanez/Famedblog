Understanding the structure of the **FaMED** (Fachsprachprüfung Medizin) is the first step to passing. Unlike standard FSP exams, FaMED follows a strict **OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination)** format.

In this guide, we break down exactly what happens in each station of the exam.

## Station 1: Anamnesegespräch (Patient History)
**Duration:** 20 Minutes

You will encounter a simulated patient (actor). Your goal is to take a focused, structured medical history.
*   **Key Challenge:** The actor may speak fast, use colloquialisms (Umgangssprache), or be emotional.
*   **Pro Tip:** Use the **SAMPLER** scheme (Symptoms, Allergies, Medication, Past history, Last meal, Events, Risks).

## Station 2: Körperliche Untersuchung (Physical Exam)
**Duration:** Integrated

While you won't perform a full exam, you must explain to the patient *what* you would like to examine and *why*.
*   **Language Focus:** Use clear, non-medical terms (e.g., "Ich möchte Ihren Bauch abtasten" instead of "Palpation").

## Station 3: Patientenvorstellung (Doctor-Doctor)
**Duration:** 10-15 Minutes

You present the case to a senior physician (Prüfer).
*   **Structure:** Use **SBAR** (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation).
*   **Key Challenge:** You must switch from "Patient German" (simple) to "Doctor German" (precise medical terminology) instantly.

## Station 4: Schriftliche Dokumentation (Medical Letter)
**Duration:** 20-30 Minutes

You must write a provisional Arztbrief (discharge letter) or admission note.
*   **Focus:** Correct grammar, standard abbreviations, and professional structure.

## Why FaMED is different?
The **OSCE format** means every candidate gets a similar scenario, ensuring fairness. This is a huge advantage over random FSP exams where you might get a "nice" or "mean" examiner.
