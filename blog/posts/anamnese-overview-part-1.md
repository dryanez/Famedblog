# Mastering the FaMED Anamnese: Part 1 - Overview & Intake Interview

The Anamnese (Medical History) section of the FaMED exam is a 10-minute station that tests your clinical communication and information-gathering skills under time pressure. Success depends on understanding its unique and fast-paced format.

## The Decisive First 30 Seconds

Right at the beginning, you receive a crucial **30-second preparation window**. During this time, two key pieces of information appear on the left side of the screen:

1.  **Your Assigned Role** (e.g., Emergency Room Physician).
2.  **The Patient's Full Name**.

**Your only task during these 30 seconds is to read and absorb this information.**

> [!TIP]
> Use this time to mentally switch into your role. If you are an ER physician, anticipate acute conditions. If you are in a practice, think about chronic management.

## Execution and Core Strategy

### The Greeting
Your first action must be to **greet the patient by name**. This is an indispensable first step that demonstrates you have used the preparation time correctly.

### Taking Notes
It is strongly recommended to **take notes through the entire conversation**. This simple action helps you:
- Keep track of questions already asked.
- Maintain a clear structure.

Under exam stress, notes are an invaluable tool to stay organized and ensure you cover all essential points of the medical history.
