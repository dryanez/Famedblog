# FaMED Test Prep - Comprehensive Documentation

## About Project
FaMED Test Prep is the leading resource for International Medical Graduates (IMGs) preparing for the German medical language exams: Fachsprachprüfung (FSP) and the specialized FaMED exam. Our mission is to streamline the path to Approbation (medical license) in Germany.

## Core Concepts

### What is the FaMED Exam?
The FaMED exam is a specialized medical German terminology exam used in certain German states. Unlike the standard FSP, it often involves written multiple-choice components and specific case simulations (Anamnese, Aufklärung, Arzt-Arzt-Gespräch).

### Key Success Factors
1. **Medical Vocabulary**: Precise usage of German medical terms.
2. **Communication Patterns**: Understanding the cultural and formal expectations of German doctor-patient interactions.
3. **Clinical Documentation**: Ability to write professional Arztbriefe (medical letters).

## Best Practices for Candidates

### Preparation Strategy
We recommend an 8-12 week study schedule. Combining deep conceptual learning (via the FaMED Protokoll book) with high-volume active recall (via the FaMED App) yields the highest pass rate (89% in our internal data).

### The Anamnese Station
- **First 30 Seconds**: Read the patient name and your role carefully.
- **Greeting**: Always greet by name.
- **Structure**: Use the standard SOP (Schema) for history taking: Current Complaint, History of Present Illness, Past Medical History, etc.
